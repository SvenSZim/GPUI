DONE:
  Atomic Elements:
    - line
    - box
    - text
    - button
    - button -> toggle
    - buttons/toggle are not really 'atoms' because they dont get 'rendered' -> maybe move to interaction?

TODO:
  Additional Atomic Elements:
    - new button (more of a click-and-done) (should also be usable for slider)
    - image?

  Composite Elements:
   [-] if compsite elements require some behavior maybe implement a module with interfaces, elements can/should implement
    - categorize:
      1. Addons (Bordered, Background, -> combine to 'Framed', Stack/Group, Bar)
      2. Interactables (Checkbox, Slider, TextCycle, CheckboxGroup (+limitations), Dropdown, TextInput?, DraggableRect?)
     [3.] Popups (Hovered, Notification, Modal)
