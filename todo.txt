DONE:
  Atomic Elements:
    - line
    - box
    - text
    - button
    - button -> toggle
  
  - buttons/toggle are not really 'atoms' because they dont get 'rendered' -> maybe move to interaction?
    
  Addons:
    - framed
    - group
    - stacked
    - section
    - dropdown

  Interactables:
    - new button (more of a click-and-done) (should also be usable for slider) = holdable
    - checkbox
    - slider
    - textcycle

  - CheckboxGroup + limitations
  - Dropdown-Select

TODO:
  Additional Atomic Elements:
    - image?

  Composite Elements:
   [-] if compsite elements require some behavior maybe implement a module with interfaces, elements can/should implement
    - categorize:
      1. Addons (Revealing, Bar)
      2. Interactables (TextInput?, DraggableRect?)
     [3.] Popups (Hovered, Notification, Modal)

  - (in progress) Create a XML-Parser to load and store UI-layouts


  Potential Problems:
    - Section: offset also scales dynamic
