# GPUI (General Purpose User Interface)
GPUI is a small python project to unify all of my humble tries to create a good looking interface to work and play with my smaller projects.

## The idea
So far i mainly worked with pygame to render/visualize my small algorithm or game showcases. Therefor all my UI's were based on the pygame functionality.
For efficiency and speed sake i slowly want to shift more towards faster visualization modules (and languages) -> my new UI should be dynamically usable with different modules.
